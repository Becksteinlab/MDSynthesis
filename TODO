TODO List
=============


Core
====

+ add class `Metadata` that serves as an interface to metadata files
    + we'd like to move away from manual edits of the metadata in-object
    + basically, atomize changes made to the metadata to ensure that it can be
      user-edited while still avoiding stale writes
    + along with this idea is full persistence: before an object ever writes out
      metadata, it refreshes its copy first

Containers
==========


Containers.Sim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Containers.Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Operators
~~~~~~~~~


Operators.Anaysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ add a progressbar scheme that shows progress of multiple systems
  in a meaningful way; current one is meant for serial use.

+ rethink the basic paradigm with decorators
    + could design a decorator that corresponds to timeseries, parallelism, or
      mix-n-match; basically, one only needs to write an analysis routine with
      minimal criteria, then decorate it!
    + will have to think hard on this to avoid too much magic that it
      obfuscates function.

Ideastorm
==========
Classes for handling md systems that are still being run?
+ integration with GromacsWrapper?
+ globus-toolkit methods and/or classes?
-> these are probably outside the scope of MDSynthesis, but I am considering
   building an "applications" package that includes specific and useful Containers
   and Operators

Markov analysis class?
+ see Michael Grabe's work on mitochondrial channels

+ Create VMD operator that can take multiple objects and load all of them
  at once.
Globus Toolkit!
+ build an Operator that can perform globus tasks on container objects
