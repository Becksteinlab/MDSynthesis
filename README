======================

MDSynthesis is an object-oriented Python framework for organizing the analysis of
molecular dynamics simulations. It is built around MDAnalysis
(http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com). While MDAnalysis allows for the detailed
dissection of simulation trajectories, MDSynthesis is designed to perform the
logistics of large-scale analysis of many trajectories, individually and as
entire groups. It allows the scientist to operate at a high level when
working with the data, while MDSynthesis handles the details of storing and
recalling this data.

The code at present is at the beginning of development. Documentation can be found
for all objects and methods in-code.
