TODO List
=============

Containers:

Containers.Sim:

+ Add automatic location checking for metafile and basedir upon generation
  of Sim object. This would make it so that the metadata is properly updated
  if the object directory is moved without a manual edit.

+ Add basic VMD method to Sim object.

+ Add the ability to give a structure or structure+trajectory to generate
  universe automatically. Saves a step for interactive work, and shouldn't
  overcomplicate the class. :)

Containers.SimSet:

+ build class to operate as a bundle of Sim or Sim-derived objects
+ make Sim objects accessible as elements of a dictionary keyed by Sim name


Operators:

+ Create VMD operator that can take multiple objects and load all of them
  at once.

Operators.Anaysis:

+ add a progressbar scheme that shows progress of multiple systems
  in a meaningful way; current one is meant for serial use.
