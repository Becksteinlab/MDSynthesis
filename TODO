Containers
==========

Containers.Sim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ Add basic VMD method to Sim object.

+ Add the ability to give a structure or structure+trajectory to generate
  universe automatically. Saves a step for interactive work, and shouldn't
  overcomplicate the class. :)

+ Add

Containers.SimSet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ build class to operate as a bundle of Sim or Sim-derived objects
+ make Sim objects accessible as elements of a dictionary keyed by Sim name


Operators
~~~~~~~~~

+ Create VMD operator that can take multiple objects and load all of them
  at once.

Operators.Anaysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ add a progressbar scheme that shows progress of multiple systems
  in a meaningful way; current one is meant for serial use.


Ideastorm
==========
Classes for handling md systems that are still being run?
+ integration with GromacsWrapper?
+ globus-toolkit methods and/or classes?

Markov analysis class?
+ see Michael Grabe's work on mitochondrial channels

Globus Toolkit!
+ build an Operator that can perform globus tasks on container objects
