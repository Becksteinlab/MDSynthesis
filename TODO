Containers
==========



Containers.Sim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Containers.Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Operators
~~~~~~~~~

+ Create VMD operator that can take multiple objects and load all of them
  at once.

Operators.Anaysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ add a progressbar scheme that shows progress of multiple systems
  in a meaningful way; current one is meant for serial use.

Ideastorm
==========
Classes for handling md systems that are still being run?
+ integration with GromacsWrapper?
+ globus-toolkit methods and/or classes?
-> these are probably outside the scope of MDSynthesis, but I am considering
   building an "applications" package that includes specific and useful Containers
   and Operators

Markov analysis class?
+ see Michael Grabe's work on mitochondrial channels

Globus Toolkit!
+ build an Operator that can perform globus tasks on container objects
