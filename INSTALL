Installing MDSynthesis
======================

Installing from source
======================

Installation is as simple as ::

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

This installs MDSynthesis in the system wide python directory; this may
require administrative privileges.

It is also possible to use --prefix, --home, or --user options for
setup.py to install in a different (probably your private) python
directory hierarchy. ``python setup.py install --help`` should show
you your options.

Selecting an installation directory
-----------------------------------

In order to install in a non-default directory one can use various
options to setup (see --help) such as ::

    python setup.py install --prefix LOCAL_DIRECTORY

or any of the other options of distutil's setup.py to install in
alternative directories, for instance

    python setup.py install --user
