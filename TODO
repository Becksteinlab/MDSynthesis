Containers
==========

Containers.Sim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ Add a top-level registry of container objects that is updated by each object
  on regenerated. This will allow Group objects to query the registry and always
  find their members, even when they move.

    + Have each container represented by a unique hash that is made from something
      unique to that object that will never be the same as another. The hash
      can be static, too, meaning that it will never be re-generated.
        + perhaps make it generated on object's initial generation?

Containers.Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Operators
~~~~~~~~~

+ Create VMD operator that can take multiple objects and load all of them
  at once.

Operators.Anaysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ add a progressbar scheme that shows progress of multiple systems
  in a meaningful way; current one is meant for serial use.

Ideastorm
==========
Classes for handling md systems that are still being run?
+ integration with GromacsWrapper?
+ globus-toolkit methods and/or classes?
-> these are probably outside the scope of MDSynthesis, but I am considering
   building an "applications" package that includes specific and useful Containers
   and Operators

Markov analysis class?
+ see Michael Grabe's work on mitochondrial channels

Globus Toolkit!
+ build an Operator that can perform globus tasks on container objects
